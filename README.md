# Etch-a-Sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch Project is part of the The Odin Project Foundation Curriculum.

The creation of the boxes was performed using a for loop which creates a certain number of div elements based on the user's range input.

The dimensions of each div was calculated by dividing the 100% width/height of the parent element by the selected range input. Moreso, I have included an event listener wherein the sizes shall dynamically change whenever the size of the window is reduced.

I added a color picker so that the users can choose the color of their sketch.

Lastly, I added a toggle button 'D' so that the users can control when the hover function is activated.
